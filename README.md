<h2>üìì Description</h2>
Vapor is a single-page React game store application that allows users to browse, search, and 'purchase' games. It's a demonstration project that utilizes the RAWG API to fetch real game data, displaying screenshots, descriptions, and details for thousands of games. Users can browse games by categories, add them to a cart, and simulate the purchasing process. While not a real store (games cannot actually be purchased), it provides links to legitimate store pages where the games are available.
